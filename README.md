# Movie Tracker with PocketBase

This project is created to explore and experiment with **PocketBase** as a backend solution.

The goal is to test and use various PocketBase features including:

- Authentication (email/password)
- Database collections and relations
- CRUD operations via REST API
- Role-based access control (rules)
- Real-time updates (optional)
- Simple file storage (optional)

This simple Movie Tracker app helps understand how PocketBase can be integrated quickly with a frontend SPA.
